        <h1>Doctor Who!</h1>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who" target="_blank">Doctor who</a> is my favorite TV show. I have binged the New Who seasons many time. To help me keep track of Doctor who eras, the original Doctor Who from the 60's is called OG Who, the reboot in 2006 starting with 9 and going to 13 is called New Who, and the Doctor Who on Disney+ is called Disney Who. New Who is my favorite era. I am a Smith and Capaldi fan, I thing 12 is sooooooooo under-rated. Clara is also amazing. I where Doctor Who pretty much daily. I have my jacket that is TARDIS+Stary Night (reference to "Vincent and The Doctor episode), three T-shirts, a couple beenies (one is a dalek head and the other is a TARDIS one), and a pair of pj pants of the same fabric my jecket. I was introduced to Doctor Who when I was 2, after my parents were introduced by my aunt who lived in the UK. My third birthday party was Dalek themed. I loooooove the Daleks.</p>
