            <li>Teacher ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡</li>
            <li>Pretty much everthing</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Things that aren't so Good</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Classmates here and there being distracitng/anoying</li>
            <li>Can I sit with my friend(Lila), please?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I like this class, defenetly my favorite class. I do miss sitting with my friend, but I can manage without if I must. Some classmates can be anoying now and again, but not the worst I've experienced. I don't know, it's good class and I want to keep coding and being head because I am bored. Will be taking programming next year. Good class, 10/10, 👍👍👍👍👍</p>
