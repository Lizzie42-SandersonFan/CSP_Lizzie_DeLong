            <h2 id="headerTwo">Who is Brandon Sanderson?</h2>
            <p>Brandon Sanderson is an author from American Fork, Utah, USA. The first book he ever published was <span id="italic">Elantris</span> and it was published in 2005. After that, was <span id="italic">Mistborn: The Final Empire</span>, which was published in 2006, with the first trilogy being finished in 2008. <span id="italic">The Way of Kings</span> was started in the late 1990s, but finished and published in 2010.

            <p>Dragonsteel hosts conventions every year towards the end of the year. It use to happen around late fall months like October, but in 2023, they anouced it will be happening in early December. These conventions use to just be called "Dragonsteel," but now they are called Dragonsteel Nexus, or DSNX for short. Every year, thousands of people from all over the world fly or drive into Salt Lake to go to these conventions and say good bye to their hard earned money in just a few hours at the Dragonsteel Shop. I would know, the money adds up fast and it doesn't help that the most popular series has ten marketable species/orginizations that ends up having every collector need each and every one, so hundreds of dollars are spent on <span id="italic"><span id="bold">plushies</span></span> in my case. They are really cute though, so it is worth it, and I need them all.</p>

            <p>Brandon has writen many books, but his most famous and most reconizable series is <span id="italic">The Stormlight Archive</span>. <span id="italic">The Stormlight Archive</span> follows many main protagonists; the main one being Kaladin Stormblessed. <span id="italic">The Stormlight Archive</span>'s magic system revolves around semi-other-worldy creatures known as inteligent spren. These spren can form bonds with humans and give them special powers that can range from making illutions, playing with the direction of gravity, turning something into dust, forming bonds with other people and things, making stone liquid, making stuff slick or not slick to play with movment, and healing wounds. Brandon has plans to make this seires <span id="bold">ten books</span> long. So far, five are released so we are half way there!</p>

        <div id="Mistborn E1">
            <h3 id="headerThree">Mistborn Era One</h3>
            <p><span id="italic">Mistborn Ear One</span> is a trilogy set in broken wasteland planet. If we were to compare the technology from them to our history, it is around the renassiance era of technology. This world's magic system involves metel. Yes, as in the metel a spoon in made of. Some people are born with the ability to "burn" a metal, which means they can ingest some of a metal they are able to burn and like, activate it in their body and it gives them powers. Generally, people can only burn one metal. These people are called Mistings. However, some people can burn all of them and these people are known as Mistborns. They burn metals through the power of <a id="link" href="https://coppermind.net/wiki/Allomancy" target="_blank">Allomancy</a>. </p>
            <p>People who can use Allomancy</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Vin</li>
                <li>Kelsier</li>
                <li>Marsh</li>
                <li>Hoid (of course)</li>
                <li>Spook</li>
                <li>Elend</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There are other ways to burn metals like <a id="link" href="https://coppermind.net/wiki/Feruchemy" target="_blank">Feruchemy</a>. Feruchemy is where people can store power or life or strength into metal that coresponds with the abiltiy being stored, but the metal has to in direct contact to the person's skin. There is also a third way called <a id="link" href="https://coppermind.net/wiki/Hemalurgy" target="_blank">Hemalurgy</a>. This is where a type of metal is physicly driven through someone who can burn that metal and the power is taken out of the person and into the spike. This spike can then be driven into someone else and the power is transfered to them. This is the only way for someone to burn more than one metal through Allomany, but in order to use that metal, the spike must stay in them. From what I remeber about the series, someone can not wield Allomancy and Feruchemy at the same time.</p>
